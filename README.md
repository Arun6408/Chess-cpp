### Rules of the Game
1. The game is played on an 8x8 board.
2. The pieces are King (K), Queen (Q), Rook (R), Bishop (B), Knight (N), and Pawn (P).
3. White moves first, followed by Black.
4. To move a piece, enter the move in the format e2-e4 (move from e2 to e4).
5. If a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it must be promoted to Q, R, B, or N.
6. If a King is in check, it must be moved out of check. If no valid moves are available, it is checkmate.
7. You cannot make a move that would put or leave your own King in check.
